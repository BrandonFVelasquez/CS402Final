# How to Play
To play our clicker game, simply load up the game on your IOS or Android device. The game will load and take you the level 1, Boise, from here you will notice markers populating the map that can be clicked! 
When clicked the marker will disappear and your click counter will go up. These markers however, only spawn every so often and quite slowly until you can unlock different power ups to speed up the spawn rate.
These powerups can be achieved with the click counter score, and when an upgrade is purchased it will subtract those points from your counter and be applied right away! You can also unlock new levels that require 
different amounts of points and must go in order. These new levels provide a new location and also different powerups. Sit back, relax, and get clicking!
